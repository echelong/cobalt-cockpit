# Disposable local smoke setup and evidence

These are opt-in test recipes, not automatic plugin installation. They require
explicit owner authorization, isolated test data, and existing prerequisites.
Never run against a production service. CPU inference was used; no paid/cloud
provider was configured. Small test logs remain under `/mnt/mem2`; large
Hindsight test resources were removed afterward.

# Verified disposable Hindsight smoke deployment

Owner authorized local CPU-only deployment on 2026-10-09. All resources created under `/mnt/mem2/cobalt-hindsight-smoke-20261009`; dedicated Podman storage/runroot and dedicated Ollama model directory/server. Existing Ollama services and model storage were not modified. API only published at 127.0.0.1:18888; Ollama binds 127.0.0.1:11437. Control plane disabled. No paid/cloud inference. Full image0.10.3 actually inspected size 2,946,709,581 bytes; digest sha256:5b6ef2b892703f0e82c448786349c88db60f06d8c9190432b68af00ce6dc45e3.

Prerequisites already installed: Podman5.8.7, pasta, Ollama0.34.4. Host uses SELinux; :Z label applied only to created pgdata. Rootless `--userns keep-id` maintains operator UID access. The initial slirp4netns attempt failed because that binary is absent; no packages installed. Initial pasta mapped-address attempt couldn't reach inference and produced a correct adapter failure, preserved separately as initial-network-failure.json. Final pasta `--splice-only -T11437` forwards only loopback TCP; no general outbound browser/network route. Host downloads happened only during explicit image/model setup. CPU-only log reports library=cpu, total_vram=0.

Exact adapter config:

```json
{
  "memory_enabled": true,
  "hindsight_endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:18888",
  "memory_retention_consent": true,
  "memory_inference_configured": true,
  "memory_timeout_ms": 300000
}
```

First successful real result: retain72,220ms (local Qwen extraction), list1 finding8ms, recall1 finding103ms, scoped forget19ms, list0 after forget5ms; missing-service unavailable2ms followed by recovery ready1ms. Returned provenance source_commit/source_dirty/run/timestamp/verification_reference survived extraction, freshness recent_reference, confidence not_assessed, relevance_scores separate. Source was a disposable fixture, not real project secrets or transcripts. Second finalized script additionally verifies the synthetic stale-lock readiness fact before admission. Final evidence.json records its result. Reflection implemented/mocked but not part of this real smoke.

Finalized second real run PASSED: retain30,478ms (CPU prompt cache), list3 extracted facts6ms, recall3 extracted facts65ms, missing service unavailable4ms, recovery2ms, scoped document deletion11ms, list0 after deletion5ms. Assertions verified actual synthetic stale-lock failure/recovery before the summary was admitted. Source commit refers to the disposable fixture repository.

Hindsight itself runs embedded PostgreSQL, worker polling, graph maintenance and consolidation. The companion does not install/start/poll it. Deletion test observed pending consolidation finish with 0 source facts after deletion. Upstream background inference must be disclosed and configured independently; no memory jobs are added by Cockpit.

Cleanup only created resources: graceful `podman stop --time30` then remove exact smoke container and exact image in separate storage, stop only recorded isolated Ollama PID. Remove only created model/pgdata/podman paths. Preserve evidence.json, initial-network-failure.json and small logs/resource manifest for audit. No shared model/store pruning.

Obscura smoke passed three times (including the main integrator rerun), with
9,046-byte renderer PNG evidence, actual JS/DOM, console error, network200,
foreign-origin block (destination server0hits), metadata refusal, fresh-context
localStorage, granted button click, timeout and recovery. Processes stopped;
screenshots were ephemeral and not persisted. The test-created runtime/dependencies/cache (~386MiB) were removed after
verification; downloading the pinned verified archive and installing the
optional dependency again are prerequisites for replay. The isolated host
bootstrap configuration was also removed.

Second hardened reruns (2026-10-09, after the independent review):

Hindsight rerun (`evidence/hindsight-smoke-2.json`, exit 0): status ready 4 ms;
retain 46,040 ms with `verification_status: verified` and outcome confirmed;
list 6 ms; recall with real reranker/semantic/keyword scores; reflect
175,435 ms returning real generated text (`reflection_real_tested: true`);
scoped forget 16 ms; list 0 after deletion; missing service unavailable 2 ms
and real recovery ready 1 ms. Non-inference observations carried the new 30 s
cap; reflection used the full configured budget.

Obscura rerun, same bubblewrap recipe with the node runtime bound read-only:

```
--ro-bind <node-runtime-directory> /node \
--setenv PATH /node/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

Checks (`evidence/browser-smoke-2.json`): real JS/DOM, 9,736-byte PNG,
console.error, network200, blocked foreign page request (target 0 hits),
metadata refusal, fresh-context localStorage, unauthorized action refused,
approved click, unauthorized fill refused, fill value mismatch refused,
approved fill mutating the real DOM, readonly and hidden fill refusal, a
redirect off the allowlist refused after landing (`redirect_hop_hits: 1`),
timeout not verified, fresh recovery. The redirect hop itself reached the
non-allowlisted target once before refusal: that is a documented residual, and
the operator's OS/egress isolation remains the containment. No screenshot was
persisted.

Obscura release archive SHA-256:
`757e7b597ba5cdd53af9fc701e0a9b80f0a8d788f545d4f82ec9ad32db77f000`.
This recipe confines the browser to a fresh network namespace with only its
local fixtures, read-only runtime/worker mounts, tmpfs, cleared environment and
no host secrets. The upstream broad private-network flag is used only inside
that namespace. Public-network sandbox deployments need their own exact
egress controls; this test does not certify them.
